🐾Pet Image Classification
A deep learning project for classifying cat and dog images using TensorFlow and Keras.

📌 Overview
This project builds an image classification model using the Kaggle Cats vs Dogs dataset. The model is trained using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with data preprocessing and augmentation techniques.
